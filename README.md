[ClaimsFromJWT 1.0](http://github.com/AdvancedREI/ClaimsFromJWT)=================ClaimsFromJWT is a set of helper functions to take a already-validated JWT and turn it into a ClaimsIdentity populated with as many standardized claims as possible.Quick start-----------Install the NuGet package: `Install-Package ClaimsFromJwt`, clone the repo, `git clone git://github.com/advancedrei/claimsfromjwt.git`, or [download the latest release](https://github.com/advancedrei/claimsfromjwt/zipball/master).Once the code has been installed, you can use the helper functions as needed. Deserialize the JWT into a Dictionary<string, object> and then pass that into JwtHelper.GetClaimsFromJwt().You can add to the arrays that map names to claims, or add additional claim mapping using the same technique. If you make any changes, consider sending us a pull request so that all can take advantage.Bug tracker-----------Have a bug?
